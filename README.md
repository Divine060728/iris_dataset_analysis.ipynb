Iris Dataset Analysis

This project is part of my data analysis learning journey. Using the classic Iris dataset, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), computed key statistics, and created visualizations to understand the dataset better.

🔹 Dataset

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with the following features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

🔹 Tasks Completed

Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas

Computed descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, standard deviation

Grouped by species to compare average measurements

Checked feature correlations

Created visualizations: histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots

🔹 Key Insights

Virginica species has the largest petals on average

Setosa has the smallest petals but widest sepals

Petal length and petal width show a very strong positive correlation

The dataset shows clear separation of species when plotted with petal features

🔹 Tools Used

Python 🐍

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn
